		new objects from other classes, organizing
		these instantiated objects into arrays for
		easy referencing, and used my teammates classes
		and methods to create a main method that runs
		the game with functionality appropriate for DEMO 1;
		using their input, suggestions, and code as an aid in 
		the creation of these elements.
